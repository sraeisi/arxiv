       "'[\\'  The issue is the expediency of the QCD notions use in the low energy region\\\\ndown to the confinement scale, and, in particular, the efficacy of the QCD\\\\ninvariant coupling \\\\\\\\bar{\\\\\\\\alpha}_s(Q^2) with a minimal analytic modification in\\\\nthis domain. To this goal, we overview a quite recent progress in application\\\\nof the ghost-free Analytic Perturbative Theory approach (with no adjustable\\\\nparameters) for QCD in the region below 1 GeV. Among them the Bethe--Salpeter\\\\nanalysis of the meson spectra and spin-dependent (polarization) Bjorken sum\\\\nrule. The impression is that there is a chance for the theoretically consistent\\\\nand numerically correlated description of hadronic events from Z_0 till a few\\\\nhundred MeV scale by combination of analytic pQCD and some explicit\\\\nnon-perturbative contribution in the spirit of duality. This is an invitation\\\\nto the practitioner community for a more courageous use of ghost-free QCD\\\\ncoupling models for data analysis in the low energy region.\\\\n\\', \"Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, to be published in ``Quantum Field Theory and\\\\n  Beyond\\'\\' (Essays in honor of Wolfhart Zimmermann on the occasion of his 80th\\\\n  birthday), WS(Singapore)\"]'"
